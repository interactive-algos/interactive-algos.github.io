                    Robotics is the science of perceiving and manipulating the
                    physical world through computer-controlled devices.

                    Robotics systems are situated in the physical world,
                    perceive information on their environments through sensors,
                    and manipulate through physical forces.

            <h2>Potentials of Robotics</h2>
            <p>
                Examples of successful robotic systems include mobile platforms
                for planetary exploration, industrial robotics arms in assembly
                lines, self-driving cars, and manipulators that assist surgeons.
            </p>
            <p>
                While much of robotics is still in its infancy, the idea of
                “intelligent” manipulating devices has an enormous potential
                to change society. Wouldn’t it be great if all our cars were
                able to safely steer themselves and avoid all car accidents?
                Wouldn’t it be great if robots can clean up nuclear disaster and
                take care of all domestic repair and maintenance tasks?

            <h2>Uncertainties in Robotics</h2>
            <p>
                To do these tasks, robots have to be able to accommodate the
                enormous uncertainty that exists in the physical world. There is
                a number of factors that contribute to a robot’s uncertainty.

            <h4>Inherently Unpredictable Environment</h4>
            <p>
                Let's take self driving car as an example. When driving, it
                is impossible to predict the weather conditions, motion
                dynamics of pedestrians and other cars, traffic lights, or
                car accidents.

            <h4>Sensor Limitations</h4>
            <p>
                Sensors are limited in what they can perceive. Cameras
                cannot see through walls, and the resolution of a camera is
                limited. Sensors are also subject to noise. And finally,
                sensors can break. Detecting a faulty sensor can be
                extremely difficult.

            <h4>Robot Actuation Noise</h4>
            <p>
                Robot actuation involves motors that are, at least to some
                extent, unpredictable. Uncertainty arises from effects like
                control noise, wear-and-tear, and mechanical failure.

            <h4>Model Limitations</h4>
            <p>
                Some uncertainty is caused by the robot’s software. All internal
                models of the world are approximate. Models are abstractions of
                the real world. As such, they only partially model the
                underlying physical processes of the robot and its environment.

            <h2>Probabilistic Robotics</h2>
            <p>
                Probabilistic robotics is a relatively new approach to robotics
                that pays tribute to the uncertainty in robot perception and
                action. The key idea in probabilistic robotics is to represent
                information by probability distributions over a whole space of
                guesses instead of a single best guess. By doing so, they can
                represent ambiguity and degree of belief in a mathematically
                sound way.
